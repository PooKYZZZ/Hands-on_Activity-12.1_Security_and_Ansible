# Hands-on Activity 12.1 – Security Automation with Ansible

**Course:** CPE 213 – Cloud Management and Security  

## Overview
Implemented security automation for Linux systems using **Ansible**, focusing on firewall management, user/group configuration, service hardening, and compliance with login banners and messages of the day (MOTD). Automation streamlined repetitive security tasks, improved system reliability, and reduced human error.

## Key Tasks
- Automated creation and removal of firewall rules using `acl_manager` roles.
- Configured users, groups, and SSH access securely.
- Managed unnecessary services/software with loops and variables for reusability.
- Applied system hardening and compliance policies (login banners, MOTD).
- Ensured consistent, organization-wide security policies across multiple servers.

## Skills & Tools
Ansible, Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS), Firewall Management (UFW/Check Point), Security Automation, Playbooks & Roles

## Reflections
Using Ansible allows security administrators to automate previously manual tasks, enforce policies consistently, and reduce errors. This project reinforced the importance of coded guidelines, secure configurations, and efficient automation in maintaining system and network security.
